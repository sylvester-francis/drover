### Durable, budgeted agent runner &nbsp;·&nbsp; plan · act · observe · survive

**An agent is a loop. drover makes that loop survive a crash and stay under budget, by running it as a [rerun](https://github.com/sylvester-francis/rerun) workflow with every model call governed by the [leash](https://github.com/sylvester-francis/leash) proxy.**

*drover orchestrates. rerun makes it durable. leash makes it affordable.*

## The pitch

An agent is a loop: plan, act, observe, repeat. Two things go wrong with that loop in production, and each already has an answer:

- **It isn't durable.** A crash halfway through a twelve-step job restarts the whole job, repeating work and paying for it twice.
- **It isn't bounded.** Nothing stops a stuck loop from spending forever.

drover is the *consumer that composes both answers*. It runs the loop as a rerun workflow (`Do(plan)`, `Do(act)`, `Do(observe)`, repeat) and points every model call at a leash proxy. **rerun makes the run survive a crash; leash makes it survive the invoice.** drover adds nothing but orchestration: no persistence of its own, no governance of its own.

    job["an agent job: goal, tools, model"] --> loop
    subgraph drover["drover: orchestration only"]
      loop["plan, act, observe loop"]
    end
    loop -->|"each step is a Do()"| rerun["rerun<br/>durable execution<br/>crash, replay, resume"]
    loop -->|"every model call"| leash["leash proxy<br/>spend governance<br/>meter, refuse, stop"]
    rerun --> store[("Store<br/>SQLite or Postgres")]
    leash -->|"forwards"| api["model API<br/>OpenAI or Anthropic"]
```

## How it works

The loop *is* a rerun workflow. Every nondeterministic input (the model's reply, a tool's result) is captured inside a `Do`, so a crash resumes at the step that was in flight instead of restarting the job:

```go
for step := 0; step < maxSteps; step++ {
    resp := Do("model-N", callModel)   // one completion, through the leash proxy
    if resp.Stopped != "" { break }    // leash tripped a budget: stop, cleanly
    if !resp.Acting()    { break }     // a final answer with no tool calls: done
    for each tool call in resp:
        Do("tool-N", invokeTool)       // a side effect, journaled once
}
```

drover holds **no state of its own**: on recovery the conversation history is refolded from the journal, since rerun is the source of truth for where a job is. A step that completed replays from the journal without re-running; a tool that was mid-flight when the crash hit re-runs (rerun is at-least-once for side effects), which is why **every tool must be idempotent**.

> The durability isn't asserted, it's tested: a crash is injected at the journal-write boundary mid-run, a fresh runner recovers over the same store, and the suite checks that the completed tool step **replays without re-running** while the un-journaled model step **re-executes at-least-once**.

## Install

```sh
go install github.com/sylvester-francis/drover/cmd/drover@latest
```

## Quick start

Run an agent with **no API key and no network**: the offline `fake` model exercises the whole durable loop.

```sh
drover run --provider fake --goal "say hello"
```

Point it at a real model **through a leash proxy** to get governance for free:

```sh
# leash is governing spend on :8080, fronting OpenAI
drover run \
  --provider openai --model gpt-5.5 \
  --leash-url http://127.0.0.1:8080 \
  --goal "fetch example.com and summarize it"
```

If the process dies mid-run, **resume it**: completed steps replay from the journal and the agent picks up where it left off.

```sh
drover resume --run <run-id>
```

The run id doubles as leash's `X-Loop-Id`, so a job and its budget are the same thing across a crash. To watch the whole stack stop an agent on its budget, offline, run [`examples/e2e/demo.sh`](examples/e2e).

## Providers

drover speaks to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, and a local Ollama, plus an offline `fake`. Gemini and Ollama expose OpenAI-compatible endpoints, so they share the OpenAI wire; Anthropic has its own. Pick one with `--provider` and a current model id:

| `--provider` | Example model | Key |
|---|---|---|
| `openai` | `gpt-5.5` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| `anthropic` | `claude-sonnet-5` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| `gemini` | `gemini-3-pro` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` |
| `ollama` | `llama3.2` | none (local) |
| `fake` | any | none (offline) |

Model ids move fast; use a current one. With `--leash-url` set, calls route through a leash proxy for governance; without it, drover talks to the provider directly. A local Ollama agent, no key and no proxy:

```sh
drover run --provider ollama --model llama3.2 --goal "summarize this repo's README"
```

## Define your own agent (in Go)

drover ships extensible interfaces, not a config DSL. An agent is a little Go:

```go
import (
	"github.com/sylvester-francis/drover/agent"
	"github.com/sylvester-francis/drover/provider"
	"github.com/sylvester-francis/drover/runner"
	"github.com/sylvester-francis/rerun/sqlite"
)

loop := &agent.Loop{
	Agent:  agent.Agent{Model: "gpt-5.5", System: "…", Tools: []agent.Tool{myTool}},
	Client: provider.NewOpenAI(provider.Config{BaseURL: leashURL, RunID: id}),
	Tools:  agent.NewToolset(myTool),
}

r := runner.New(sqlite.New("drover.db"), loop)
r.Recover(ctx)         // resume anything a restart left mid-flight
r.Start(ctx, id, goal) // launch a new job (returns immediately; use r.Wait to block)
```

A `Tool` is one small interface, and it must be idempotent, because rerun may re-run it on recovery:

```go
type Tool interface {
	Schema() model.ToolSchema
	Invoke(ctx context.Context, args json.RawMessage) (string, error)
}
```

## The governor seam

drover speaks to whatever the leash proxy fronts (OpenAI or Anthropic) and reads leash's verdict straight off the wire:

| leash responds | drover does |
|---|---|
| `200` | decode the reply, then act or answer |
| `429` **with** `Retry-After` | rate-limit backpressure: a durable `Sleep`, then retry |
| `429` **without** `Retry-After` | a budget boundary: **stop the run, cleanly** (`Done`, not failed) |
| `5xx` / network | transient: retry with durable backoff |

A budget stop is a *clean* termination: the run finishes `Done` with the reason recorded, because the governor doing its job is not a failure of the agent.

## What building this taught us about rerun

drover is rerun's flagship consumer, and a real agent loop surfaced one sharp edge worth knowing: **rerun preserves a step's return _value_ across replay, but not its error's concrete _type_**. A replayed error comes back as a generic `*StepError`, so branching on `errors.As(err, &SomeType)` inside a workflow silently diverges on recovery. drover encodes every decision (a governor stop, a rate limit) as a **value** on the response, and branches only on error *presence*. If you build on rerun's engine, keep control flow branching on journaled values, never on error types.

## Guarantees & non-goals

**drover is `v0.x` and unstable:** the API may change between minor versions.

**What it is:** an orchestrator that composes rerun (durability) and leash (governance) into a durable, budgeted agent runner.

**Non-goals,** deliberately not provided, because each belongs to a layer below:

- **No persistence of its own.** rerun's journal is the source of truth for where a job is.
- **No governance of its own.** leash meters and caps spend; drover just routes calls through the proxy. This keeps leash's "governs *any* agent" property intact: drover is one durable agent among many, not a special case.
- **No provider SDK lock-in.** drover speaks to whatever endpoint the leash proxy fronts.
- **No config DSL.** Agents are defined in Go.

## Family

- **[rerun](https://github.com/sylvester-francis/rerun):** the durable-execution engine (crash-safe, replay-on-recovery workflows).
- **[leash](https://github.com/sylvester-francis/leash):** the spend governor (a reverse proxy that stops a run when it trips a budget).
- **drover:** the durable agent runner that composes both.
